ABOUT
=====

Loopers is a simple SuperCollider program which enables instant recording and replay of signals form your input. 


TODO
====

- [x] recording live input into a buffer (10s?) (auto resizable?)
- [ ] control input level
- [ ] monitor input level

- [x] playing back buffer contents - loopable
- [x] playing in reverse
- [x] control output level
- [ ] monitor output level

- [x] multiple instances!

- [ ] reverb on input signal
- [ ] control amount of reverb on input signal
- [x] reverb on output signal
- [ ] control amount of reverb in output signal

ADVANCED/FUTURE:
- [ ] view the waveform
- [ ] normalize
- [ ] set IN/OUT points of the loop
- [ ] waveform zoomout regardless of length of the buffer
- [ ] autosave buffers into soundfiles immediately after they are recorded
- [ ] switch to any previously recorded sounds
- [ ] prelisten a buffer on alternative output (3-4th channel?)
- [ ] be channel-agnostic (can record and playback n-channel buffers)?
